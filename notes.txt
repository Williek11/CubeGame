Fake Beta V 0.4
The one with dungeons

On the works:
ToDo - 5 : dungeon exploration-like feeling
Why : If I do it too late, I will have to rewrite tons and tons of code. Too much, alright! That's too much!

=- ToDo (probably too high expectations but we're goin' with it) =-

1. beautify menu with CSS
2. level creator
* drag and drop enemies and the map gets saved onto your local storage and you can then play on it
3. more bosses
4. inventory system (maaybe)
** use weapons to kill enemies instead of only dashes
** obtained by bosses
5. dungeon exploration-like feeling (maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaybe and probably a strech for my *cough* lack of skills *weird face*)
** get even more loot
** levels get longer and have different stages divided in cubes (something like the grid system like arrow.io multiplayer, in which the map is divided in cubes)
6. Optimizations. Lots of it.
